    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<br/>


<ul>
<li>Code: I will post various problems and solutions for the problems I run into.</li>
<li>Business: I will talk about different brands, interesting articles and business practices good and bad.</li>
<li>Life: I enjoy life to the fullest</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some people drift through their entire life. They do it one day at a time, one week at a time, one month at a time. It happens so gradually they are unaware of how their lives are slipping away until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The thought of that is absolutely scary. One of my business mentors always has told me to visualize myself as a lemon and at the very end of life, you want to make sure you have squeezed every drop of life out of that lemon.</p>

<br/>


<h2>Commitment <br/></h2>

<p>My goal is to update this site <strong>once a week</strong> or as I come across coding issues that have caused me major headaches. To try and help you avoid what I went through in a lot shorter time.</p>
