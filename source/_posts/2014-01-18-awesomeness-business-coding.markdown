Welcome to my blog!
<br/>


  - Code: I will post various problems and solutions for the problems I run into.
  - Business: I will talk about different brands, interesting articles and business practices good and bad.
  - Life: I enjoy life to the fullest

> "Some people drift through their entire life. They do it one day at a time, one week at a time, one month at a time. It happens so gradually they are unaware of how their lives are slipping away until it's too late."

The thought of that is absolutely scary. One of my business mentors always has told me to visualize myself as a lemon and at the very end of life, you want to make sure you have squeezed every drop of life out of that lemon.

Commitment <br/>
------------
My goal is to update this site **once a week** or as I come across coding issues that have caused me major headaches. To try and help you avoid what I went through in a lot shorter time.
